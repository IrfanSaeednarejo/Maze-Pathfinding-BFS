# 🧭 Maze Pathfinding using Breadth-First Search (BFS)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to solve a maze navigation problem. It generates a random maze and visualizes the shortest path from a start to a goal point using BFS. The maze is created with user-defined size and wall density, and always ensures a valid path exists.
