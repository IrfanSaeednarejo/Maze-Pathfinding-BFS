# Maze-Pathfinding-BFS
This project implements a maze-solving algorithm using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in a randomly generated grid maze. Users can define maze size and wall density, program guarantees a valid path between the start and goal. Visualization using Matplotlib.
